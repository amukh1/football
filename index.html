        <span class="b">About Us</span>
        <p class="d">We are a one of a kind NFT project that is coming to the Solana blockchain. Our NFTs will have tons of utility. We also are going to be giving away 175 of our NFTs before mint including a 1/1. Also, our project will not have a whitelist to give everybody in our community an equal chance at getting one on mint day. But what we will do is we will gift the 25 most active people on the server a free NFT from our collection on mint day.</p>
